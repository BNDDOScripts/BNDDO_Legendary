## Notes

This script will only spawn legendary animals at this time. You will need to make sure the carcasses and the pelts work with your butcher script and stables/wagon script. I will not offer support on this, please work with the author of those scripts. 

If you are using GUM Stables or VORP_Hunting I will answer a few questions. This script was build around those two systems
